# Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI)

## LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data.

## There are four possible commands:
* node liri.js my-tweets [insert Twitter handle]
  * This will show the last 20 tweets of the specified Twitter account and when they were created in the terminal/bash window.
* node liri.js spotify-this-song [insert song name]
  * This will show relevant information about the song in the terminal/bash window
* node liri.js movie-this [insert movie name]
  * This will show important movie information in the terminal/bash window
* node liri.js do-what-it-says
  * This will, for some reason, show you pertinent information about the Backstreet Boys' "I Want it That Way"
